**The goal of this project is to build an object recognition system that can detect objects from an input image and identifying the detected objects on the image by drawing a rectangle around each object on the image and classify it to be one from a 5 objects (CAT, Laptop, Apple, Helicopter, and Car).


**Used concepts: Algorithms and Pattern Recognition.

**Used Algorithms:
        
**Feature Extraction: Features will be extracted of each object through using:
        
        -> GLCM to extract 4 features (Contrast, Entropy, Energy and Homogeneity.
        
        -> The run-length matrix to extract 11 features.
        
        
**Classification Algorithms:
        
        -> Modified K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
        
        -> R-Near Neighbors (RNN).
        
        -> Support Vector Machine (SVM).
